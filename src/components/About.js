                        <p className="p-2">Hello! My name is Tayo and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My
                            interest in <span className="highlight">web development</span> started back in 2020 when I wondered how the internet worked and
                            decided to make my personal findings. It's been a rough ride as i tried out alot of stuffs
                            personally before a friend taught me a lot about HTML & CSS.
                            <br/> <br/>
                            Fast-forward to today, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working at a <span className="highlight">logistic agency, a start-up, and a cryptocurrency educational platform</span>.
                             My main focus these days is <span className="highlight">building accessible</span>, inclusive products and digital experiences for a variety of clients.
